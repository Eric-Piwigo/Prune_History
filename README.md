# Prune_History
Piwigo plugin - Prune History allows to
- prune manually history table according a date range,
- save the table before a purge and restore it if you made a mistake,
- download the saved table as a SQL file,
- automatically purge the table according to a criterion of data retention

After plugin installation in your Piwigo gallery, go to the plugin's settings page. Check out the online help tooltips for details.

This plugin does not prune Piwigo's history summary (simple count of pages viewed) but the detailed history items like guests and authenticated users history details that could take a lot of space in your database.
